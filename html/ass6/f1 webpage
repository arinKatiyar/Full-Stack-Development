    <p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel
        single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The World
        Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier
        forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the
        set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a series of
        races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
