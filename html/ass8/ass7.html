    <h1>Motorsports</h1>
    <p>Motorsport, motorsports or motor sport is a global term used to encompass the group of competitive sporting
        events which primarily involve the use of motorized vehicles. The terminology can also be used to describe forms
        of competition of two-wheeled motorised vehicles under the banner of motorcycle racing, and includes off-road
        racing such as motocross.</p>

    <h3>Formula racing</h3>
    <p>Formula racing is a set of classes of motor vehicles, with their wheels outside, and not contained by, any
        bodywork of their vehicle. These have been globally classified as specific 'Formula' series - the most common
        being Formula One, and Formula Two. Many others include the likes of Formula 3, Formula Ford, Formula Renault
        and Formula Palmer Audi. However, in North America, the IndyCar series is the most followed open-wheeled racing
        series. Former 'Formula' series include Formula 5000, GP2 and GP3.</p>

    <h3>Formula One</h3>
    <p>Formula One is a class of single-seat and open-wheel Grand Prix closed course racing, governed by the Fédération
        Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), and currently organized by the privately owned company Formula One Group.
        The formula regulations contain a very strict set of rules which govern vehicle power, weight, size, and design.
        The rules do allow for some variation, however.</p>
